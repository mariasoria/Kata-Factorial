# Factorial

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
By convention the value of 0! is 1.

For example: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. 

Write a function to calculate factorial for a given input.

If input is below 0 or above 12 throw an exception of type:
* ArgumentOutOfRangeException (C#) or
* IllegalArgumentException (Java) or
* RangeException (PHP) or
* RangeError (JavaScript) or
* ValueError (Python) or return -1 (C).
